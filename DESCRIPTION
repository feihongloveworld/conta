Description: Detect contamination from whole genome sequencing data. 
    Input data comes in the format of tsv files which is a pileup from SNPs, 
    and contains the MAF value for each SNP. Otherwise MAF is generated through
    a merge with dbsnp vcf file. The contamination module builds a baseline 
    profile and calculates the likelihood on each SNP for different 
    contamination levels. The contamination level that maximizes the 
    sum of log likelihood ratios (against 0 contamination) is reported as the 
    level of contamination along with the confidence in the value which comes 
    in sum of log lr and average log lr per SNP. Other metrics and graphics 
    are also reported to support a contamination call.
