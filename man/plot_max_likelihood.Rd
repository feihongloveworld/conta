\title{Plot log likelihoods and mark the top score}
\usage{
plot_max_likelihood(cf_range, grid_lr, opt_val, save_dir, sample)
}
\arguments{
\item{cf_range}{numeric range of contamination fraction}

\item{grid_lr}{numeric initial grid that was searched}

\item{opt_val}{list optimized result}

\item{save_dir}{character location to save the results}

\item{sample}{character sample name}
}
\value{
none
}
\description{
Each contamination fraction (cf) value that was tested will be plotted
and the top scoring cf highlighted with a red cross. This plot enables
us to see the distribution of log likelihoods.
