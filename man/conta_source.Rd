\title{Run conta source detection}
\usage{
conta_source(base, out_file, cores = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{base}{character base directory with a batch of conta results}

\item{out_file}{character output file}
}
\value{
none
}
\description{
Reads a base folder with each conta result under a folder. Each conta run
should contain one *.conta.tsv and *.gt.tsv that correspond to conta
results and genotypes/contaminants of that sample. Conta source detection
will identify the samples for which conta made a call, and then compare its
contaminant reads against genotypes of every other samples' genotypes.
}
\details{
For each genotype comparison, maximum likelihood that is obtained by using
the genotype of the contaminant as the contamination probability
is compared against the original maximum likelihood that is obtained by
using the MAF as the prior. If this likelihood is higher, then the sample
is reported as with the highest likelihood. 2nd and 3rd highest scoring
source candidates are also reported.
